# Backlog

## Done

- Usage history by time and model
  - Added local SQLite history recording for sampled usage percentages.
  - Added rolling day, week, month, and year chart views.
  - Added aggregate and per-model series when model buckets are available.
  - Added CSV export and clear-history controls.

- Validate model bucket behavior against live Codex data
  - Added hidden Option-context-menu diagnostics export.
  - Added sanitized app-server bucket JSON with aggregate/model comparison summaries.
  - Added classification for comparable, independent, and inconclusive bucket shapes.

- Review exported diagnostics and decide History chart semantics
  - Added multi-capture diagnostics review for comparable, independent, and inconclusive evidence.
  - Kept the History chart in neutral independent-signal mode until real captures prove contributor semantics.
  - Added internal contributor rendering support for evidence-backed comparable buckets.

- Improve History chart polish and interaction
  - Added nearest-timestamp hover inspection with per-bucket usage details.
  - Replaced the horizontal series toggle strip with a searchable model selector.
  - Added specific empty states for no history, no selected-range data, and hidden series.

- Add data-management preferences
  - Added a native Data settings pane for history database location, size, reveal, backup, restore, and clear actions.
  - Added raw-sample retention presets while keeping hourly and daily rollups indefinitely.
  - Added SQLite backup export/import with validation and history-change notifications.

- Add install/update visibility
  - Added local version/build visibility in the popover.
  - Added an Updates settings tab with app metadata, install/update commands, project link, and release notes.

- Add live update checking
  - Added GitHub latest-release checks without changing the manual install flow.
  - Added up-to-date, update-available, no-release, inconclusive, checking, and failure states to the Updates settings tab.

- Add release packaging and versioning workflow
  - Added local scripts to set semantic app versions, validate releases, and package unsigned zip assets.
  - Added release instructions for tags, GitHub Releases, and manual artifact validation.

- Add signed/notarized distribution
  - Added optional Developer ID signing and notarization to local release packaging.
  - Kept unsigned local packaging available while documenting the recommended signed public release path.

- Make History charts easier to read
  - Replaced sampled line charts with bucketed bar charts for hourly, daily, and monthly views.
  - Added a default Capacity left metric with a Usage toggle for peak consumption.
  - Added peak rollups, bucket hover details, and chart-shaped CSV export.

- Add calendar-period History navigation and axis labels
  - Changed History charts from rolling ranges to explicit local day, week, month, and year periods.
  - Added bounded previous/next period navigation for both inline and full History charts.
  - Simplified x-axis labels to hours, weekdays, day numbers, and month names by selected range.

- Add GitHub Actions release automation
  - Added a manual release workflow for signed, notarized GitHub Release assets.
  - Kept local release scripts as the source of truth while adding CI keychain and notary support.
  - Documented required repository secrets and protected-branch behavior.

- Add in-app update download/install flow
  - Added release asset decoding for signed GitHub Release zip downloads.
  - Added download staging, checksum/trust verification, and guided no-admin app replacement.
  - Added Settings UI states for downloading, verifying, ready-to-install, install fallback, and errors.

- Add History chart period polish
  - Added a compact jump-to-current control and clearer disabled navigation hints.
  - Added period-aware CSV filenames while keeping the current calendar-period model and local-only storage behavior.

- Add token usage telemetry capture
  - Added app-server `thread/tokenUsage/updated` notification decoding.
  - Persisted live token telemetry with input, cached input, output, reasoning output, total, last-turn, cumulative, context-window, thread, turn, timestamp, and nullable model fields.
  - Added deduped observed-token deltas so repeated streaming updates do not inflate daily totals.

- Add menu-bar token display option
  - Added a persisted `Tokens` menu-bar display option, default off.
  - Appends today's captured token total to the existing capacity text when enabled.
  - Shows `-- tok` when selected before token telemetry has been captured.

- Add token history charts
  - Added token-volume History charts for the existing day, week, month, and year periods.
  - Added total, input, cached input, output, and reasoning token categories with local SQLite queries and CSV export.
  - Kept token volume separate from rate-limit capacity and usage charts.

## Next Candidates

- Backfill token history from local Codex sessions
  - Parse metadata-only token records from `~/.codex/sessions` and `~/.codex/archived_sessions`.
  - Avoid reading or displaying message content, prompt history, auth tokens, or logs.
  - Use this as an optional one-time import after live token capture is proven.

- Add lightweight update notifications
  - Optionally check for updates during normal sessions and surface a visible popover/settings prompt.
  - Keep downloads and installs user-initiated.
